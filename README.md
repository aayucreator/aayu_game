Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic paper-and-pencil game played on a grid of nine squares. Two players take turns marking X or O in an attempt to get three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. It's a simple yet engaging game that tests strategic thinking and prediction skills.
